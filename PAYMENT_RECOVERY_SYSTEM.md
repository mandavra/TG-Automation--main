## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Recovery Service Architecture**
```javascript
class PaymentRecoveryService {
  // Core Methods:
  findFailedDeliveries()      // Identifies payments needing recovery
  processFailedDeliveries()   // Processes all failed deliveries  
  retryPaymentDelivery()      // Retries specific payment with backoff
  deliverChannelLinks()       // Sends links via Telegram API
  getRecoveryStats()          // Provides system statistics
  startAutoRecovery()         // Starts automatic recovery service
}
```

### **Smart Detection Logic**
Identifies failed deliveries using multiple criteria:
```javascript
const failedPayments = await PaymentLink.find({
  status: 'SUCCESS',
  $or: [
    { link_delivered: { $ne: true } },           // Not marked as delivered
    { delivery_status: 'failed' },              // Explicitly failed
    { 
      updatedAt: { $lt: new Date(Date.now() - 10 * 60 * 1000) },  // Over 10 minutes old
      link_delivered: { $ne: true }             // Still not delivered
    }
  ]
});
```

### **Retry Strategy**
- **Attempt 1**: Immediate retry
- **Attempt 2**: 5 second delay  
- **Attempt 3**: 10 second delay
- **Attempt 4**: 20 second delay
- **Attempt 5**: 40 second delay
- **Max Delay**: 5 minutes cap
