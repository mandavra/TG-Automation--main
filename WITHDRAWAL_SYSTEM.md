# Admin Withdrawal Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive withdrawal system that allows regular admins to request withdrawals from their earnings, while super admins have full control to approve/reject requests and directly withdraw from any admin's account.

## System Architecture

### **Admin Flow:**
1. **View Balance**: Check total earnings, withdrawn amounts, and available balance
2. **Request Withdrawal**: Submit withdrawal requests with bank/UPI details
3. **Track Requests**: Monitor status of withdrawal requests (pending/approved/rejected/completed)

### **Super Admin Flow:**
1. **Dashboard**: View all withdrawal statistics and pending requests
2. **Manage Requests**: Approve or reject admin withdrawal requests
3. **Direct Withdrawals**: Directly withdraw from any admin's account
4. **Admin Profiles**: View individual admin earnings and withdrawal history

## Database Schema

### WithdrawalRequest Model
```javascript
{
  adminId: ObjectId,           // Admin requesting withdrawal
  amount: Number,              // Withdrawal amount

  paymentMethod: String,       // bank_transfer/upi/wallet

    accountNumber: String,
    ifscCode: String,
    bankName: String,
    accountHolderName: String,
    upiId: String              // For UPI payments
  },
  adminNotes: String,          // Admin's withdrawal reason
  processingNotes: String,     // Super admin's processing notes
  processedBy: ObjectId,       // Super admin who processed
  processedAt: Date,           // Processing timestamp
  transactionId: String,       // Bank transaction reference
  type: String,                // 'request' or 'direct'
  availableBalance: Number     // Balance at request time
}

## Balance Calculation System

The system calculates admin balance using:

1. **Total Earnings**: Sum of `adminCommission` from successful payments
2. **Total Withdrawn**: Sum of approved/completed withdrawal amounts
3. **Pending Withdrawals**: Sum of pending withdrawal requests
4. **Available Balance**: `Total Earnings - Total Withdrawn - Pending Withdrawals`

## Withdrawal Status Flow

```
1. pending    â†’ (Super admin approves) â†’ approved â†’ completed
              â†’ (Super admin rejects)  â†’ rejected

2. direct     â†’ (Super admin creates) â†’ completed (immediate)
```
